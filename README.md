# Turing Commons Resources

On this branch, you will find the resources for the Turing Commons that are kept separate from the main branch to minimise the time it takes to build our site using GitHub Actions and Pages.
Typically, these resources have larger file sizes.
You can access here include the following:

- Presentation Recordings
- Slide Decks
- Archived Modules or Sections

## ðŸ§© Skills Track Resources

There are additional resources associated with our skills tracks that are kept on the main branch, and accessible through the appropriate page of our website.
For example:

- Gallery
- Activity Handouts
- Facilitator Guides
- Case Studies
