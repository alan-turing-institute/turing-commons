# Contributing to _The Turing Commons_

:tada::smile: **Welcome to _The Turing Commons_ repository!** :smile::tada:

Thank you for visiting the *The Turing Commons* repository!
We hope that the information provided in this document will make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.

This repository primarily exists to host and support a [series of online courses](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/) on the topics of Responsible Research and Innovation, Public Engagement of Data Science and AI, and AI Ethics & Governance.

We welcome all contributions to this project via GitHub issues and pull requests.
Please follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated into the projects.

If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Methods of Contribution

There are several ways you can contribute:

1. Write a [blog post](#blog-posts) 📝
2. Fix typos or bugs 🪲
3. Support with community events or outreach 👥

### Blog Posts

There are five types of posts that can be written and published on the Turing Commons platform:

- **News**: a post announcing a significant update to the Turing Commons platform.
- **Event**: a post announcing a new event (e.g. course) or other time sensitive update (e.g. calls for application)
- **Digest**: a post that serves as a digest for either a new topic or an existing concept in one of the Turing Commons' modules (300–500 words).
- **Feature**: A longer or more in-depth post that explores or presents a topic or idea that would not fit within an existing module or skill track.
- **Engagement**: a post oriented towards a wider audience, which serves as some form of engagement (e.g. a 'top 10' list that serves as a hook for new readers)

For new contributors, the **Digest**, **Feature**, or **Engagement** categories are likely the best fit.
If you'd like to see some ideas of blog posts we are interested in, visit our [idea backlog](https://hackmd.io/L64mlF-aSU6Y2WC-Jkxbyw?edit) and feel free to submit a proposal for one of those!

#### What to send us

Ready to get involved? Great! Here is what you will need to send us:

1. Full names of authors
2. Working title
3. Abstract or draft (250 word maximum) of the blog post
4. Which category in the list of 5 post types above the piece belongs to (Note: We will not accept a post unless it has a category.)
5. E-mail address for how we can get in touch with you

#### How to submit

To submit a proposal to the *The Turing Commons* blog, you can use the following options:

- Open an issue on our [Github repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-commons/) using the blog proposal template
- E-mail us at cburr@turing.ac.uk

##### Writing in Markdown

All blog articles will eventually need to be submitted in the Markdown format.
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as **bold** (`**bold**`), or in _italics_ (`_italics_`), or as a [link][[rick-roll](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)] (`[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

When writing in Markdown, please start each new sentence on a new line.
Having each sentence on a new line will make no difference to how the text is displayed, there will still be paragraphs, but it makes the [diffs produced during the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests) review easier to read! :sparkles:

### Fix typos or bugs

While we do not currently accept proposals for main content in our courses, we welcome any help regarding to problems in our repository.
This can include typos, content issues (e.g. missing references, false or problematic statements), improvements to our community documentation (e.g. README files), and any technical issues (e.g. problems with pages not rendering correctly, or improvements to the code base).

#### How to fix issues

Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-commons/issues) to let us know about issues using the appropriate template (e.g. `content`, `code`).

In order to contribute via GitHub, you'll need to set up a free account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going.

### Support with community events or outreach

Information on how you can help with upcoming community events or outreach will be coming soon!

### Community Principles

_The Turing Commons_ aims to be inclusive to people from all walks of life and to all research fields.
These intentions must be reflected in the contributions that we make to the project.

We encourage intentional, inclusive actions from contributors. Here are a few examples of such actions:

- use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language (learn more about inclusive writing on page 22 of [University of Leicester Study Skills pdf](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/ssds/oers/study-skills/studyskills.pdf), also available as a [zipped html](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/ssds/oers/study-skills/studyskills_HTML.zip)).
- aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds such as science, humanities and social sciences by not limiting the scope to only scientific domains.
- make sure that the colour palettes are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors. See the blogpost [Designing Scientific Figures for Colour Blindness](https://www.lewismackenzie.science/blog-1/2017/2/9/designing-scientific-figures-for-colour-blindness) for an example of how somebody improved one of their diagrams, including links to recommended colour palettes and a colour-blindness simulator.

## Recognising Contributions

We welcome and recognise all kinds of contributions, from fixing small errors, to developing documentation, maintaining the project infrastructure, writing chapters or reviewing existing resources.
_The Turing Commons_ follows the [all-contributors][all-contributors] specifications.
The all-contributors bot usage is described [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).
You can see a list of current contributors [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-commons/blob/master/contributors.md). 😍

To add yourself or someone else as a contributor, comment on the relevant Issue or Pull Request with the following:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```

You can see the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `<contribution>` types.
The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor and reply with the pull request details.

**PLEASE NOTE: Only one contributor can be added with the bot at a time!**
Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`) before adding another one.
Otherwise, you can end up with dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].
Therefore, please check the open pull requests first to make sure there aren't any [open requests from the bot](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-commons/pulls/app%2Fallcontributors) before adding another.

What happens if you accidentally run the bot before the previous run was merged and you got those pesky merge conflicts?
(Don't feel bad, we have all done it! 🙈)
Simply close the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`).

Finally, don't forget to add yourself to the list of contributors [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-commons/blob/master/contributors.md)!
