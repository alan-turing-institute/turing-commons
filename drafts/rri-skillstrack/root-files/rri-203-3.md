## The Computational Allure of Statistical Fairness

Fairness in ML and AI has seen enormous interest over the last decade, as many researchers and developers try to bring order to a vast and complex landscape of statistical concepts and measures.
This is understandable.
Statistical measures are, typically, well-defined and bring a quantitative dimension to the discussion of fairness.

Attempting to translate fairness into a statistical problem, therefore, has a certain allure because it suggests that if we can get the right measure or formula we can "solve" the problem of fairness in an objective manner.
However, the allure of this statistical or computational approach needs to be properly seen for what it is—an important tool, but one that has many limitations and needs to be used responsibly.
This section is about understanding both the strengths and limitations of statistical fairness.

----

As a simple example of one limitation, consider the following question:

> Is it fair for a company to build an AI system that monitors the performance of employees in a factory and automatically notifies them when they are not meeting their targets? Or, should the company instead invest in better training and support for employees and work with their staff to understand obstacles or barriers?

----

As you can probably guess, there is no easy answer to this question.
In fact, you may have realised that a lot depends on factors that are not appropriately specified in the question (e.g. what happens if the staff continue to miss targets, who is this company, and who are their staff?).
However, putting aside these unspecified factors, it should be evident that such a question cannot be reduced solely to some statistical problem.

Here, judging the fairness of the company's actions would require a more holistic approach, one that takes into account the social and cultural context of the company and its staff.
Within this more holistic approach, statistical fairness could be one tool that is used to help inform the discussion, but it will not be the only tool.

Therefore, in this section we will take a critical look at some proposed statistical concepts and techniques for understanding fairness in ML and AI, paying close attention to how they can contribute to the discussion of fairness, and where they fall short.

## Fairness in Classification Tasks

The area of ML and AI that has seen the most attention, with respect to fairness, is the task of classification.

In a classification task, the goal is to predict which class a given input belongs to.
This high-level description can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including:

- Which object is depicted in an image?
- Is this applicant likely to default on a loan?
- Is a post on social media an instance of hate speech?
- Will this patient be readmitted to hospital within 30 days?

----

In this section, we are going to follow this approach and build up our knowledge of statistical fairness by using a simple binary classification task as a running example.

This simplification has a cost and a benefit:

- The cost is that we will not be able to capture the full complexity of statistical fairness in ML and AI, such as exploring all relevant metrics, or different types of problems (e.g. multi-class classification, non-classification tasks, etc.)
- The benefit is that we will be able to focus on the core concepts and ideas and link them to ethical and social issues of fairness.

With these caveats in mind, let's dive in.

---

### Classifying Patients: A Running Example

First of all, let's introduce our classification task.

We're going to pretend that we are developing a classification model, using supervised learning, which will try to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on a set of features.
We're not going to worry about what this disease may be or what the features are that we are using to train the model—our first oversimplification.
Instead, let's just assume we have a sample of 100 patients and 2 of them have the disease.

<!-- show and label graphic of 100 people with two coloured differently -->

----

#### Statistical Fairness Issue #1: Class Imbalance and Accuracy

When designing this model we may decide that evaluating the performance of this model is best achieved by measuring its accuracy.

However, this is where we come to our first problem that statistical fairness has to address: class imbalance.

In our sample of 100 patients, only 2 of them have the disease.
This means that if we were to build (an admittedly terrible) model that always predicted that a patient does not have the disease, then the model would have an overall accuracy of 98%.
From one (very limited) perspective, the model would be performing very well, but we obviously know that this is not the case.

When we have imbalanced classes (i.e. a small number of positive examples), which is quite common, such a simplistic notion of accuracy is not going to be sufficient.

----

## Positive Classes

In ML classification, the term 'positive class' is used to refer to the class that we want to identify or predict.
For example, in a medical diagnosis task, the positive class might represent the presence of a particular disease, while the negative class represents its absence.

This can sometimes cause confusion, as the term 'positive' is often used to refer to something that is good or desirable, but in some tasks the identification of the positive class may be related to an undesirable or negative outcome.

<!-- end admonition -->

----

Fortunately, there is a well-understood approach to dealing with this initial limited notion of accuracy: a confusion matrix.

A confusion matrix is a table that helps us to visualise the performance of a classification model by showing where it is doing well and what errors it is making.
The table below shows a typical confusion matrix, where the rows represent the predicted label (i.e. the model's prediction) and the columns represent the ground truth (i.e. the actual state of the world).

| | Actual Positive | Actual Negative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predicted Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Positive (FP) |
| **Predicted Negative** | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN) |

----

Let's translate this general table into our running example.

Here, the positive class is the presence of the disease, while the negative class is the absence of the disease.
Therefore, the four cells would correspond to the following:

- True Positive (TP): The patient has the disease and the model correctly predicts that they have the disease.
- False Positive (FP): The patient does not have the disease but the model incorrectly predicts that they do have the disease.
- False Negative (FN): The patient has the disease but the model incorrectly predicts that they do not have the disease.
- True Negative (TN): The patient does not have the disease and the model correctly predicts that they do not have the disease.

## Different Terminology

Depending on your background, you may know some of the terms in this section by different names.
For example, 'False Positive' is sometimes referred to as a 'Type I Error', and 'False Negative' is sometimes referred to as a 'Type II Error'.

This will also hold true for terms we define later in the section.
This is unavoidable in such a multi-disciplinary context, although it is acknowledged that this can be confusing.
Therefore, you may need to refer to this section more frequently than other sections.

<!-- end admonition -->

----

We can also represent this visually based on how our model performs with respect to the original dataset.
Let's return to our original 100 patients, but this time let's make the disease a bit more prevalent (30/100 patients have the disease now), and let's see how well our model does at predicting the disease this time around.

<!-- show the circular graphic where 30 patients having the disease and the following distribution of positives and negatives

- TP: 25
- FP: 5
- FN: 5
- TN: 65

 -->

This graphic allows us to see where our model has classified positive and negative instances correctly and incorrectly.
The data points (i.e. patients) within the circle represent the positive class (i.e. having the disease), whereas those outside of the circle represent the negative class ()
And this approach also allows us to use the four values to define new metrics that can help us to understand the performance of our model.

----

Let's define some key terms, all of which are based on the original confusion matrix:

| Name | Label | Definition | Formal Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Actual Positives | `P` | The number of data points in the positive class, regardless of whether they were predicted correctly or incorrectly. | `P` = `TP` + `FN` |
| Actual Negatives | `N` | The number of data points in the negative class, regardless of whether they were predicted correctly or incorrectly. | `P` = `TP` + `FN` |
| Accuracy | `ACC` | The proportion of data points that were correctly predicted from the entire dataset. | `ACC` = (`TP` + `TN`) / (`P` + `N`) |
| Precision (or Positive Predictive Value) | `Precision` or `PPV` | The proportion of data points that were predicted to be in the positive class that were actually in the positive class. | `PPV` = `TP` / (`TP` + `FP`) |
| Recall (or True Positive Rate, or Sensitivity) | `Recall` or `TPR` | The proportion of data points in the positive class that were correctly predicted. | `TPR` = `TP` / `P` |
| False Positive Rate | `FPR` | The proportion of data points in the negative class that were incorrectly predicted. | `FPR` = `FP` / `N` |

----

## List of Metrics

There are many more performance metrics that can be extracted from a confusion matrix.
We focus on the above ones simply because they are the ones needed for understanding some of the key concepts we discuss later on in this section.
 
The following table from (Ruf and Detyniecki, 2019)[^ruf] is a helpful reference for the most common metrics, and their paper is also an excellent resource in general.

<!-- add image of table of metrics -->

<!-- end admonition -->

----

We have already looked at the first three terms, let's now look at `Precision` and `Recall`.

These two terms are often introduced in tandem because of how they relate to each other.
To get a general understanding of the two terms, consider the following image.

<!-- insert fishing image -->

Here, the objective is to catch as many fish as possible.
We can think of catching a fish as our *positive class*.

The "model" used by the boat on the left (i.e. the fishing rod) is very precise—it catches some of the fish (i.e. true positives), but not all of them, and it does not produce match bycatch (e.g. false positives).

The "model" used by the boat on the right, however, has good recall—it catches all of the fish (i.e. true positives), but it also produces a lot of bycatch in the process (e.g. false positives).

This analogy is useful because it allows us to understand the trade-off between precision and recall.
As we raise the classifier's boundary (i.e. increase the size of the net), we will increase the number of true positives for our model (or minimise the number of false negatives).
However, in doing so, we will also increase the number of false positives.

But, if we lower the boundary (i.e. decrease the size of the net), we return to a situation where we have a higher number of false negatives but a lower number of false positives.

This is known as the **precision-recall trade-off**, and it brings us to our next statistical fairness issue.

#### Statistical Fairness Issue #2: The Precision-Recall Trade-off

This issue of where to "draw" the boundary for our classifier is a common one in machine learning, and the choice is in part a value-laden one.
Both precision and recall are trying to maximise the number of true positives, but they also try to minimise the number of false positives and false negatives, respectively.

| Metric    | Measures           | What it Optimises |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Precision | TP / (TP + FP)     | Lower Rate of False Positives |
| Recall    | TP / (TP + FN)     | Lower Rate of False Negatives |

Another way to frame the intuition here is that `precision` is not as concerned with a higher number of false negatives, whereas `recall` is not as concerned with a higher number of false positives.

But, this translates into very different scenarios in the real world.

In our running example, a model with high `precision` will result in a higher rate of false negatives, which means that some patients may not receive treatment when they need it.
In contrast, a model with high `recall` will capture more of these patients but some patients who do not need to be sent for further tests may have their time wasted and receive unsettling news.

In general, therefore, a high recall value is typically preferred because we generally deem the harm caused by a false positive to be less than the harm caused by a false negative.
But this is not always the case—"recall" our example of the fishing boat, where minimising the amount of bycatch may be more important to ensure sustainable fishing practices.


<!-- list of statistical fairness issues -->

1. Class imbalance and accuracy
2. Classification may depend on a prior choice about where to *set a threshold*
3. The limits of *protected characteristics*
4. Training data can include *proxies for sensitive characteristics*
5. The data are considered the *ground truth*
6. Maintaining the *status quo* is not always fair

## Choosing fairness metrics

Group-level fairness only provides assurance that the average member of a (protected, marginalsied or vulnerable) group will be treated fairly. No guarantees are provided to individuals. 

<!-- activity: taboo trade-off, which possession would people save from a burning building. designer to evoke variation in assessment of the sacred (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-of-taboo-tradeoff/) -->

Humans have tried to quantify fairness for centuries. The Law of Hammurabi, for exmaple, states that if a man "destroy's the eye of a man's slave or beaks a bone of a man's slave, he shall pay one-half his price". Fortunately, such simplistic laws are no longer adhered to in modern society. 

<!-- incentivising unethical practice, allows people to do cost/benefit analysis on harming others intentionally. Also creates unitended consequences, such as the charge for late pickups at a nursery. -->

- A metric is a measure, typically representing the distance between two objects as represented on some standard scale (e.g. length in centimetres).

- Although the use of specific scales leads many to falsely attribute objectivity to statistical measures of fairness, this fallacy overlooks a core value-laden assumption: which measure to choose.

<!-- illustrative example from partial case study showing lack of flexibility in algorithmic features and protected characteristics -->

### Sufficient Statistics for Merit

A statistic is defined as sufficient if it cannot be replaced with another statistic derived from the same sample, such that the replacement provides any additional information regarding the parameter in question.

## Evaluating Fairness

<!-- this is where we should bring in all the technical stuff from @ruf2021 and @carey2021 

- Differential false positive rates
- Problems of defining fairness across individual and group level categories
    - Fair when considered as an inividual level, but due to historical factors baseline rates of reoffence are different across black and white defendants (i.e. black people are more likely to be arrested in the US due to systemic racism).
    - It is not possible to be fair to individuals and groups at the same time.

-->

### It's about more than just accuracy

Statistical notions of fairness when applied to ML/AI prioritise distributional notion of fairness, such as those that look to ensure equal error rates across sub-groups. But as [Barocas et al](https://fairmlbook.org/legitimacy.html) note:

> "One danger of the machine learning approach is that it leads to a narrow focus on the accuracy of the prediction. In other words, “good” decisions are those that accurately predict the target. But decision making might be “good” for other reasons: focusing on the right qualities or outcomes (in other words, the target is a good proxy for the goal), considering only relevant factors (in a sense we’ll discuss below), considering the full set of relevant factors, incorporating other normative principles (e.g., need, desert, etc.), or allowing people to understand and potentially contest the policy. Even a decision making process that is not terribly accurate might be seen as good if it has some of these other properties."

## Notes

- Have a slide with a confusion matrix that shows how each segment connects to the corresponding graphic representation of data points in a circle
- Use the analogy of trawling to help explain precision and recall
- Precision is sometimes referred to as positive predictive value (PPV), specifically in binary classification problems, because it represents the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by a model or test (i.e. TP / P). To put it simply, PPV is the probability that a positive prediction is correct. In the context of a classifier used in medical diagnosis, for instance, PPV is the probability that a patient has a disease (TP) given that the classification result is positive. Because some test results will come back positive even when a patient does not have the disease, the set of all positive test results can be considered P in this example. If the classifier has high PPV, it means that the likelihood of a positive test result correctly indicating the presence of a disease is high.
  - PPV is an important metric in contexts that have high costs or consequences for missed positves (i.e. false negatives). This is because it measures the accuracy of positive predictions, which is particularly relevant in scenarios where positive predictions are rare (i.e. the minority class).

> "A general rule is that when the consequences of a positive prediction have a negative, punitive impact on the individual, the emphasis with respect to fairness often is on precision. When the result is rather beneficial in the sense that the individuals are provided help they would otherwise forgo, fairness is often more sensitive to recall."

## Unused Resources

- Obermeyer et al. (2019) example of algorithm that contained racial bias due to using predicted health care cost as proxy for how sick an individual was. However, due to systemic barriers to accessing healthcare, or implicit biases of healthcare professionals, Black individuals were treated unfairyly. Only 17.7% of patients that the algorityn assisgned to receive extra care were Black.
    - Other examples: 
        - Women are less like to be shown ads for high paid positions like CEO or CFO (Datta et al. 2015)
        - Black women are less likely to be inaccurately classified by facial recognition systems (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018)
