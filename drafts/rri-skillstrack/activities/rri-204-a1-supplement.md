# Sample Claims

This is a supplementary document to be used alongside the [Selecting and Evaluating Claims](rri-204-a1.md) activity.

Each claim in the following set is about a hypothetical project, model, or system.
Various details have been omitted to focus on the claim itself.
You should not need to know anything beyond what is expressed in the claim itself to complete the associated activity.
Instructions are available [here](rri-204-a1.md).

There are 15 claims in total.
5 claims have been designed as examples of 'project transparency' explanations, 5 claims have been designed as 'model interpretability' explanations, and 5 claims have been designed as examples of 'situated explanations'.
However, the explanations also differ in terms of their quality, so some may be harder to identify than others.

Answers can be found using the 'Reveal Answers' admonition at the bottom of this document, if accessing online.

## Set of Example Claims

!!! info

    The following claims are not in any particular order.

1. "We chose to create a secure environment for performing data processing (e.g. extraction, analysis, and preprocessing) because our data is highly sensitive. In addition, this level of security prevents us from making information about our pipeline available to the public."
2. "We chose to use a neural network model because it gives us the highest levels of accuracy."
3. "Our stakeholder analysis process identified several groups of stakeholders, including the general public. To ensure that we met the different explainability requirements, we explored multiple processes for developing accessible explanations. For example, technical auditors have access to the results of comp lementary interpretability methods (i.e. Integrated Gradients and SHAP), while members of the public can access general information about how our system was built and implemented."
4. "Because of the context in which our system is intended to be used, there was a risk that our system could have lower levels of accuracy for specific sub-groups. Therefore, we have ensured that the information about our training data and a variety of feature summary statistics are available to assist bias mitigation and assessment efforts."
5. "We used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)to help visualise the regions of an image that were most important for a particular prediction made by a neural network. We chose this technique because it is effective at generating visual explanations that are easy to understand and interpret, even for non-technical stakeholders."
6. "Our project has been carried out in accordance with best practices for transparency, interpretability, and explainability. Our AI system can provide clear and transparent insights into how it is making predictions that can be easily understood and trusted by stakeholders."
7. Our system is for educational purposes only and will only be used by technical specialists. As such, no specific explanations about the system are needed, but our source code and notebooks are available on a public GitHub repository."
8. "Our random forest model outperforms other models we tested, and has also been designed with interpretability in mind. Firstly, we used permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values to identify the most important features in the model. Then, we used supplementary techniques to visualize how the model responds to changes in individual features as well as to provide a more detailed understanding of the decision-making processes within the model. These methods and techniques allowed us to identify specific rules and patterns that are driving the model's predictions. We tested these outputs with a variety of our stakeholders to ensure they can be easily understood by people with a wide range of backgrounds and technical expertise."
9. "Our system is expected to be used by healthcare professionals in time sensitive situations. As such, simple explanations are required, even if this means some explanatory quality is lost."
10. During our project, several models were extensively tested and evaluated using a range of interpretability methods, including sensitivity analysis and counterfactual analysis, to ensure that we trained and validated a robust and reliable model. The results of these tests are available in our documentation, which also provides information about why this approach was needed to build trust with stakeholders."
11. "To ensure regulators and auditors can fully assess the trustworthiness of our project and system, we have published a wide variety of documentation about our system, including details of our data collection and analysis process, as well as preliminary risk management process, such as an equality impact assessment carried out to identify risks of bias and discrimination."
12. "We developed a decision tree model to ensure it was intrinsically interpretable by a wide range of stakeholders. The important features and thresholds are clearly represented, and instructions for employing additional visualisation software (e.g. `dtreeviz`) are also available in our documentation."
