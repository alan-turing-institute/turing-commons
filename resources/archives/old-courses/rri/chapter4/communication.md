# Engaging, Communicating, Assuring

In this final chapter, we will consider what it means to communicate the processes and outputs of your research or innovation project in a responsible manner.
Although we have already looked at several relevant mechanisms for communication, such as [stakeholder engagement](../chapter3/project_design/planning.md) or [model reporting](../chapter3/model_development/model_reporting.md), these mechanisms are only two pieces within a larger puzzle.
They play a significant role in supporting the early parts of a project's lifecycle, but some aspects of responsible communication go beyond any single stage or even the overall lifespan of a project.

Take a typical scientific research project.
It is quite common for a research project to publish findings and then receive ongoing public interest for some time after the scope of the project itself.
This may come in the form of engagement with policy-makers, journalists, other researchers, commerical organisations looking to apply the findings, or perhaps even citizen interest groups.
Each of these groups will have a different objective or rationale that motivates their interest and engagement with a project's research process or findings.
It is important to take these factors into consideration, as they can have a big impact on how a research or innovation project will be perceived.

There is, of course, a limit on how much responsibility (and accountability) a project team can take for the use (or misuse) of their research by others.
For example, if a commercial organisation ignores a project team's clear advice and thorough documentation about the applicability of a model to a novel context, the project team should not be blamed.
But this depends on whether the original communication and engagement was exercised in a responsible manner.
The commercial organisation, for instance, should not be entirely blamed if the project team gave misleading or incomplete details about their work.

It can be difficult to identify when sufficient responsibility has been exercised though.
After all, there is a big space between, on the one hand, publishing scientific findings in the public sphere and then assuming an entirely *laissez faire* approach to how the research is used and interpreted, and on the other hand, attempting to monitor every use or application of the findings to ensure that no harms arise.
In this chapter, however, we will seek to provide an intuitive (albeit partial) method (or, procedure) to help address this challenge of delineating or demarcating the scope and substance of a project team's responsibility for ongoing communication and engagement.

!!! note "Additional Guides"

    Before we discuss the method, however, we should note that there is significant overlap here with the content of our two other courses:
    
    1. Public Engagement and Communication of Science (PES)
    2. AI Ethics and Governance (AEG)
    
    The first of these two courses (PES) goes into more detail about the scientific and ethical rationale for public engagement, and also looks at how novel technologies are shaping the communication of science.
    The second course explores the normative foundations of public discourse, drawing upon work in discourse ethics and jurisprudence and extending their central themes to help address challenges of governing AI technologies that operate in a global and intercultural context.

    The topics and themes explored in these courses develop the notion of 'responsible communication' in important ways.
    And, arguably, an understanding of 'responsible communication' would be incomplete without reflecting on some of the conceptual issues that the above two courses consider.
    However, there is a limit to how much can be covered in any single course, so we won't delve into these issues here.
    We encourage you to look into these courses if you're interested.

We will end this guide, therefore, by exploring a *unifying framework* that helps draw together the themes and activities we have already explored in this course, and which also provides a foundation for responsible communication.
Unlike the topics and scope of the other courses, our present concern has a more (direct) pragmatic goal: the development of an *assurance case* that helps communicate and justify that you have exercised responsibility throughout a research or innovation project.
