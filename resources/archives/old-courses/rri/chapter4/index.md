!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    In this chapter we will look at what happens when a project reaches the stage where it is necessary to communicate research findings or present the output of the innovation lifecycle to a broader audience. We will consider a method known as argument-based assurance, which has been designed to help developers and project members engage their audience in a trustworthy and transparent manner.

    - Consider the basics of the argument-based assurance methodology
