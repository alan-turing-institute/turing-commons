# Model Productionalisation

Unless the end result of the project is the model itself, which is perhaps more common in scientific research, it is likely that the model will need to be implemented within a larger system.
This process, sometimes known as 'model operationalisation', requires understanding (a) how the model is intended to function in the proximate system (e.g. within an agricultural decision support system used to predict crop yield and quality) and (b) how the model will impact—and be impacted by—the functioning of the wider sociotechnical environment that the tool is embedded within (e.g. a decision support tool used in healthcare for patient triaging that may exacerbate existing health inequalities within the wider community).
Ensuring the model works within the proximate system can be a complex programming and software engineering task, especially if it is expected that the model will be updated continuously in its runtime environment.
But, more importantly, understanding how to ensure the model’s sustainability given its embeddedness in complex and changing sociotechnical environments requires active and contextually-informed monitoring, situational awareness, and vigilant responsiveness.

As noted, this stage of the product lifecycle involves often complex forms of software engineering, which in many cases are just about ensuring appropriate software dependencies and packages are installed that allow users of the system to access or interface with the model as intended (e.g. building and coding an API).
This is not to deny that there are important ethical issues involved with model productionalisation, especially with how an API either enables inhibits access to the benefits of a model.
However, we can consider these issues elsewhere (e.g. during '[project planning](../project_design/planning.md)' or '[user training](user_training.md)' and in a way that doesn't presuppose familiarity with technical concepts.
Therefore, we will keep this section as a brief note.
