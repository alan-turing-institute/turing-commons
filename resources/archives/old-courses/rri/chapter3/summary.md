# Next Steps

The overview and summary of the project lifecycle presented in this chapter, by necessity, skips over a lot of detailâ€”both practical and theoretical.
However, the framework has been designed with 'sustainability' in mind, and so it should be able to accommodate subsequent additions.
For instance, perhaps there is a method of bias mitigation or explainability that has not been considered.
Hopefully, the framework as it stands should be able to integrate this into the unifying reflective and deliberative procedure without needing to alter any of the overarching considerations.

This remains to be seen.
For the time being though, the project lifecycle framework provides a useful anchor for subsequent discussion, and serves to motivate the following question:

> How do you **responsibly communicate** the actions and decisions undertaken throughout the project lifecycle stages to an audience with diverse needs and expectations?

This can be challenging, because there may be a range of ethical values that are implicated in your project, which in turn affect a plurality of goals and needs for the various stakeholder groups, including ensuring that the system being deployed is safe, secure, fair, trustworthy, explainable, sustainable, or respectful of human agency and autonomy.
How do you provide assurance that the interconnected project processes and activities individually and collectively support the relevant goals?
This is the topic of our final chapter.
