  <p>
    Responsible scientific research and technological innovation (RRI) is a
    vital component of a flourishing and fair society. As an area of study and
    mode of enquiry, RRI plays a central role within academic, public, private,
    and third-sector organisations. This course will explore what it means to
    take (individual and collective) responsibility for (and over) the processes
    and outcomes of research and innovation in data science and AI. The notion
    of 'responsibility' employed throughout this course will be grounded in an
    understanding of the moral relationship between science, technology, and
    society, exploring both historical and contemporary examples of RRI
    practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    As well as looking at the theoretical basis of RRI this course will also
    take a hands-on approach by exploring a variety of tools and procedures that
    can help operationalise and implement a robust notion of responsibility
    within research and innovation practices.

      Primarily, this skills track is for researchers with an active interest in
      data science or AI research and innovation. This doesn't mean you have to
      be a data scientist, or a researcher using R or Python to analyse data.
      You could be an ethicist, sociologist, or someone with an interest in law
      and policy. However, the module is oriented towards research issues and
      related topics.

      Primarily, this guidebook is for researchers with an active interest in
      public engagement, specifically in the context of data science and
      artificial intelligence. This doesn't mean you have to be a data
      scientist, or use Python to develop machine learning algorithms. You could
      also be an ethicist, sociologist, or someone with an interest in law and
      public policy. This course has practical, and sometimes hands-on
      activities that are designed to a) encourage critical reflection and b)
      help you build practical understanding of the processes associated with
      effective and responsible public engagement in data science and AI. While
      they can be carried out as part of individual and self-directed learning,
      they are most suited to group discussion.

  <p>
    This course is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of AI Ethics
    and Governance. The course begins with an introduction to meta-ethics and
    normative theories. It then follows with the practical ways AI systems can
    produce diverse harms to individuals, society, and even the biosphere, as
    well as the values that should be upheld when thinking about AI ethics. The
    course then goes into a deeper dive on the following topics: AI
    Sustainability through Stakeholder engagement and impact assessment, AI
    fairness and bias mitigation, accountability and governance, explainability
    and transparency, and the CARE & Act principles.

  <h2>Data Justice</h2>

  <p>
    In this course we explore the emerging movement of data justice, which seeks to apply a social justice-oriented approach to examining the range of social, political, and material concerns arising within our increasingly datafied society. This chapter is guided by the work undertaken by the Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice (ADJRP) project and its current understandings of data justice through inclusive and intercultural approaches.
