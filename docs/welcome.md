# Welcome

Hello 👋
This is the Turing Commons—a home for resources and tools to help you reflect, discuss, and take responsibility for the design, development, and use of data-driven technologies.

Confused by that last sentence?
Don't worry you're still in the right place.
We have a range of resources for those curious about the ethical and responsible use of data, regardless of whether you're a curious citizen looking to have greater control over local matters, or a data scientist looking to take more responsibility over the consequences of your research.

This site is a living resource, however, which means the content is constantly being updated, revised, and refined. At present, the site is a home for several guidebooks, which have been designed for specific training courses we are in the process of delivering.

These guidebooks are themselves being updated and added to, so may be in different states of completeness and readiness. You can access them via the links below, or using the menu on the left.

- [Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)](/rri/index.md)
- [Public Engagement of Data Science and AI (PED)](/ped/index.md)
- [AI Ethics & Governance (AEG)](/aeg/index.md)
- [Citizen's Guide to Data: Ethical, Social and Legal Issues](https://zenodo.org/record/5568861#.YWfmRS8w1hE)

## Accessibility Statement

We would like to ensure these resources are accessible for as many people as possible.
At present, this site is configured to allow users to:

- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- use a screen reader or translation tool on most of the content

For keyboard navigation, <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>keys can be used to scroll up and down on the current page.
<kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys can be used to move forwards and backwards through the pages of the book.
Tabbed content (including code example) can be focused using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys are then used to focus the required tab option, where <kbd>Enter</kbd> can be used to select that option and display the associated content.

However, we know that more can be done.
If there is something that can be improved, please let us know by [getting in touch](mailto:cburr@turing.ac.uk), [raising an issue](https://github.com/chrisdburr/turing-commons/issues), or even contributing on GitHub 👇.
