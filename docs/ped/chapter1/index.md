# What is Public Engagement?

You may think that the answer to this question is so obvious that it is not worth asking the question in the first place.
Or, perhaps you would give an answer along these lines:

> Public engagement is a process of dialogue between researchers and members of the public with the goal of either a) determining the attitudes or beliefs of the public or b) informing them of developments in science and technology.

An answer such as this would capture a significant part of what public engagement involves. However, it would also miss some important nuance and detail.

The purpose of this section is to develop a more careful and extensive understanding of what public engagement is and entails, which will then serve as the foundation for the remainder of the course.
