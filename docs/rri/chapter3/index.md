!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    In this chapter we will work our way through the key stages of the project lifecycle: (project) design, (model) development, and (system) deployment. 
    For each stage, we will describe the accompanying activities, and highlight some of the salient ethical, social, and legal issues. 
    However, this is presented at a relatively high-level of abstraction in the guide, because the material relies heavily on the use of [case studies](case_studies.md) and accompanying activities to flesh out some of the context-specific issues. 
    Therefore, if you are reading this chapter as part of an individual, self-directed study, you may have to adapt the activities a little. 

!!! example "Learning Objectives"

    In this chapter, you will:
    
    - Gain a high-level understanding of the central stages of the project lifecycle: (project) design, (model) development, and (system) deployment.
    - Explore the activities that are associated with each of the three stages, focusing on salient ethical, social, and legal issues.
    - If you are following this material as part of a live course, you will also engage in practical discussions and activities, using several illustrative case studies to help you better understand how to conduct responsible data science and AI.
