-   :material-thought-bubble:{ .lg .middle } __Understanding Responsibility__

    ---
    **Module: What is Responsible Research and Innovation?**
    This activity helps participants reflect on a series of scenarios that constitute moral dilemmas. Participants will learn to identify moral agents and moral subjects, consider what the moral responsibilities of the agents are, as well as think about conflicts or interests or values that may arise.

-   :material-graph:{ .lg .middle } __Collective and Distributed Responsibility__

    ---
    **Module: The Project Lifecycle**
    This activity uses the project lifecycle model to get participants thinking about the different remits of responsibility that fall within different stages of the lifecycle. The activity prompts reflection about the upstream and/or downstream dependencies the successful completion of these tasks have, as well as the importance of understanding responsibility as collective and distributed.

    **Module: Fairness (*SAFE-D*)**
    This activity is designed to gte participants to identify and understand how different biases can impact the design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies. It uses the project lifecycle model as a scaffold, and asks participants to consider how a variety of biases (social, statistical, and cognitive) could enter the project lifecycle and impact downstream decisions and outcomes. It also asks participants to think about tailored strategies for minimising the impact of biases.

-  :material-telescope:{ .lg .middle } __Selecting and Evaluating Claims__

    ---
    **Module: Explainability (*SAFE-D*)**
    
    This activity is designed to identify, understand, and evaluate claims made about a project, data, model, or system in service to providing an explanation to a stakeholder or affected user. You will need to identify the objective of the claims as well as their quality, using a case study as an anchor.
