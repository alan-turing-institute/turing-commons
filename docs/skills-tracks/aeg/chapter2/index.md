## Chapter Outline

- [AI Harms](harms.md)
- [AI Values](values.md)

!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    Following an brief introduction into the world of practical ethics, we now turn to AI Ethics in particular. We start this chapter by identifying the different *kinds* of harms AI systems can create, be it to particular individuals, communities, society as a whole, or even to the biosphere. 
    Additionally, we then turn to the values that drive issues behind AI ethics. In particular, we focus on what we call the SUM values, as they support, underwrite, and motivate a responsible innovation ecosystem. They are: protect, respect, connect, and care.
