!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

      The last chapter of the course is divided into two sections. First, we will delve into the concepts of transparency and explainability in AI, looking at the difference between the two, and the various types of AI explanations.

      In the second half of the chapter we will bring everything back together with a review of the CARE & ACT principles. These principles serve as a practical tool to ensure AI systems are developed in an ethical and responsible manner. They are the following: 

      - Consider context
      - Anticipate impacts
      - Reflect on purpose, positionality, and power
      - Engage inclusively
      - Act transparently and responsibly
