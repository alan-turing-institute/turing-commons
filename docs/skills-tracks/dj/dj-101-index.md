!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    This chapter introduces the six pillars of data justice: power, equity, access, identity, participation, and knowledge. Stemming from the work undertaken by the Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice (ADJRP) project, these pillars are intended as guiding priorities to guide the critical reflection of data justice through wider ethical considerations, rather than technocentric ones. 
    
    Each pillar is explored through its own dedicated subchapter and through a set of guiding considerations that can be used as a framework for furthering the data justice movement. 

!!! example "Learning Objectives"

In this chapter you will:

- familiarise yourself with the six pillars of data justice; and
- learn about how unjust data practices and data-intensive technologies can be examined, critiqued, challenged, and reimagined using the scaffolding provided by these six guiding priorities.
