# Mobilising for Data Justice

The path to data justice has many complex and systemic challenges, yet individuals and communities around the world are paving a hopeful path. In this final episode of the data justice documentary series by The Alan Turing Institute, we hear from our global partners on how they mobilise for data justice through their transformative activism and advocacy. They shed light on the actions we need to take now to disrupt longstanding structures of inequity. This episode features two partner perspectives; Project Adal from Digital Rights Foundation with HOPE and MƒÅori Data Rangatiratanga from Digital Natives Academy (29:09 in duration).
