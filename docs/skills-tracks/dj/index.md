  In this course we explore the emerging movement of data justice, which seeks to apply a social justice-oriented approach to examining the range of social, political, and material concerns arising within our increasingly datafied society. This chapter is guided by the work undertaken by the Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice (ADJRP) project and its current understandings of data justice through inclusive and intercultural approaches.
