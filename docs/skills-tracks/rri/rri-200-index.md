# About these Modules
The following are the five optional modules for the RRI skills track. 
Each module focuses on one of the SAFE-D principles. These are overarching ethical principles which highlight crucial dimensions relevant when thinking through the practical applications of responsible research and innovation.

The principles are: sustainability, accountability, fairness, explainability, and data stewardship. 
To complete the RRI skills track, *at least one* of the five modules must be completed. 
However, there is no limit as to how many modules may be completed before moving into the final core module: responsible communication and open science.
