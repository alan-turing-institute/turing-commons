Data analysis is typically split into two types: `exploratory` and `confirmatory` analysis:

- Exploratory data analysis allows analysts to better understand the structure and content of the dataset, and identify possible associations between data types and variables.
- Confirmatory data analysis is where initial hypotheses that are developed in the previous stage are evaluated using a variety of statistical methods (e.g. significance testing).

## Importance of Task

In the context of responsible research and innovation, data analysis is vital to the assessment of myriad biases that can negatively impact a project, many of which are most obvious at this stage in a project.

Identifying and dealing with missing data is particularly important during this task. 
Although upstream stakeholder engagement activities can help mitigate the impact of this bias, identifying the scope of its impact and determining how effectively it can be addressed (e.g. using various methods imputation, collecting additional data), will largely depend on the quality of the data analysis task.
