# About this Module

This module introduces the Project Lifecycle model which depicts the process of designing, developing, and deploying an AI system. 

It unpacks the usefulness of the model for several processes or outcomes, and then presents each of the twelve stages of the model in detail, accompanied by illustrative examples.

## Learning Objectives

This module has the following learning objectives:

- Understand why the project lifecycle model is called a heuristic model, and why models can only ever be heuristic.
- Identify the main properties of the model and who it is for. 
- Explore the pragmatic uses of the model.
- Identify the twelve stages of the project lifecycle and why they are relevant to the different ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise throughout the design, development, and deployment of a project.
